I am **Vashu Chauhan**, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student at **IIIT Delhi** (GPA 8.72/10) with a deep interest in **multimodal and language-based reasoning systems**, interpretable feature discovery, and scalable data-centric pipelines for structured and unstructured learning tasks, as well as **Multimodal Agentic Systems**.

My research spans three exciting collaborations:

- **TU Darmstadt Research Fellow** (Data and AI Labs, Feb 2026–Present) — investigating learning-driven optimization strategies for adaptive streaming data systems under real-time and resource constraints, advised by Prof. Manisha Luthra Agnihotri and Prof. Carsten Binnig.
- **Adobe Research Intern** (Noida, Aug 2025–Present) — proposed **FEST** (Feature Engineering with Self-evolving Trees), a principled framework for automated, interpretable feature engineering; and architected **Brand Genome**, a knowledge-graph representation of visual brand identity.
- **IBM Research Intern** (Remote, Aug 2024–Jun 2025) — designed a scalable data generation and validation pipeline for enterprise LLM fine-tuning; work **nominated for Best Paper Award (Industry Track) at EMNLP 2025**.

I have publications at **EMNLP 2025**, **AAAI 2026**, and papers under review at **ICML 2026** and **ECCV 2026**. I was selected as a **Research Fellow under the Athene Young Investigator Programme** at TU Darmstadt and received a **research travel scholarship ($1,750 USD)** to present at the AAAI Student Abstract Track.
